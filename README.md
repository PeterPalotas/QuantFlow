# AlgoDash

**AlgoDash** is a real-time cryptocurrency trading dashboard built with Java and Spring Boot. It connects to the Binance exchange to visualize live market data and execute trading strategies created by the user.

This project was built to explore the bridge between raw, high frequency financial data and an interactive, visual frontend. It serves as a clean, self contained example of a full stack Java application that processes a live data stream, applies an algorithmic model, and presents the results in an intuitive dashboard.

## Overview

AlgoDash provides a complete, end-to-end system for algorithmic trading visualization.

**Current features:**
* **Real-Time Candlestick Chart:** Displays live BTC/USDT price action with multiple, switchable timeframes (5s, 15s, 1m).
* **Live Indicator Overlays:** Functionality to visualise indicators used by a chosen strategy directly on the price chart, updated in real time.
* **Portfolio Simulation:** Tracks a simulated portfolio's value, cash, and crypto holdings as the strategy executes trades.
* **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays key metrics like Win Rate, Profit Factor, and Max Drawdown.
* **Trade Log:** Shows a running history of all BUY and SELL orders executed by the strategy.

## How It Works

The application is architected into several decoupled services that work in concert:

1.  **`BinanceDataService`:** Connects to Binance using both the REST API (for historical data) and WebSockets (for live trades). Its only job is to fetch data and pass it on.
2.  **`BarAggregatorService`:** Consumes live ticks from the `TradingEngineService` and aggregates them into `Candle` objects for various timeframes, firing an event when a new bar is closed.
3.  **`Ta4jAdapterService`:** Acts as a translator between the application's `Candle` objects and `ta4j`'s `Bar` objects, maintaining the official `ta4j` `BarSeries`.
4.  **`IndicatorManagerService`:** Manages the lifecycle of all `ta4j` technical indicators. Strategies register their needs with this service, which then creates and updates the indicators automatically.
5.  **`TradingStrategy`:** A pluggable interface for trading logic. Its `onCandleClose` method requests values from the `IndicatorManagerService` to make a decision.
6.  **`TradingEngineService`:** The central orchestrator. It receives data and events from other services and directs the flow of information between the data pipeline, the strategy, and the portfolio.
7.  **`Frontend (The Dashboard)`:** A single-page application using vanilla JavaScript and the **ApexCharts** library. It polls the backend every second to get the latest `DashboardState` and redraws the UI, creating a real time experience.


## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for **educational purposes only**. It uses a simulated wallet and does not connect to real exchange order books. Financial markets are volatile and trading involves substantial risk of loss. The metrics and signals generated by this tool are based on a simplified model and do not guarantee future market movements.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

    *   The application will start fetching live data from Binance immediately.

## 📝 TODO: Future Improvements
*The features displayed below are in no particular order*
- [x] **Refactor `BinanceService`:** Split the monolithic service into focused components (`TradingEngine`, `DataService`, `PortfolioService`).
- [x] **Advanced Strategy Hooks:** Improve the `TradingStrategy` interface by providing an `onCandleClose()` event.
- [x] **Expand Indicator Support via `ta4j`:** Replace all custom indicators with `ta4j`'s comprehensive library.
- [ ] **Implement Backtesting Engine with `ta4j`:** Leverage `ta4j`'s built-in backtester to create a `BacktestService` for rapid, offline strategy testing and optimization.
- [ ] **Backtesting UI:** Create a user interface for the backtesting engine, allowing users to select a strategy and date range, and view performance reports.
- [ ] **Manual Backtesting:** Implement a "market replay" mode allowing users to step through historical data, place simulated trades, and test discretionary strategies.
- [ ] **Manual Trade Execution:** Implement frontend buttons (Market/Limit orders) and backend endpoints to allow for manual execution of BUY and SELL orders.
- [ ] **Strategy Selector:** Add a UI component to dynamically select and activate different `TradingStrategy` implementations at runtime.
- [ ] **Multi-Asset Support:** Create new data services (e.g., for Yahoo Finance) to allow the dashboard to analyze assets beyond cryptocurrency.
- [ ] **Enhance Volume Analysis with `ta4j`:** Utilize `ta4j`'s data structures to properly handle volume data, enabling volume-based indicators and analysis.
- [ ] **Improve interface:** Make interface more complex with additional metrics, and features.
- [ ] **Refactor frontend:** Make the frontend code cleaner, and split it into several files to isolate JS functions, css, etc...
